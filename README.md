# Love-calculator# Love Calculator

The Love Calculator is a simple Python program that calculates a "love score" between two names.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter two names.
2. It assigns numeric values to each letter in the names (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).
3. It sums up these values for both names.
4. It calculates a "love score" by taking the modulo 101 of the total value.
5. It displays the love score as a percentage (ranging from 0 to 100).
